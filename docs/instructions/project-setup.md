# Project setup
In this section, you can find steps that are needed for setup the project locally.

## Necessary steps

- [ ] **1.** [Create a ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

- [ ] **2.** Run git clone git@github.com:toptal-core-interviews/todo-lists-interns.git to clone our to-do repo

- [ ] **3.** Run cd <name of the folder where you cloned project> to navigate to folder with the cloned project

- [ ] **4.** Run git checkout -b my-playwright-branch to create a new branch

- [ ] **5.** Set proper Node version (specified in .nvmrc file) - suggestion is to install NVM so you can easily changed node versions

- [ ] **6.** Set proper Ruby version (specified in backend/.ruby-version file)

- [ ] **7.** Install dependencies and run the TO DO app locally (please follow [this](https://github.com/toptal-core-interviews/todo-lists-interns/blob/master/docs/development.md) instructions - you should run fronted and backed or everything with Docker)
