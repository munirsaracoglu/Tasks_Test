# Assignment Instructions - API
In this section, you can find everything we expect in your assignment from the **API** standpoint. Feel free to treat it as a checklist.

## Required Tasks
- [ ] **1.** Perform an Exploratory Testing session against the application to acquire practical knowledge about it. Report any mismatching behavior between the app and its [specifications](../requirements.md) through the Issues area of this repository. It is not necessary to report every single issue you find, so report the ones you find most important as you would in a real project, limiting to a maximum of 5 issues;
- [ ] **2.** Cover 5 requirements from the [specifications](../requirements.md) of this application with API tests. Choose the ones you find most important in terms of quality. Assume every validation documented there should have been reflected in the API level. Feel free to use any API testing library, but make sure your solution is crafted with **Ruby**. The endpoints of the REST API are documented [here](../api.md);
- [ ] **3.** Enhance [development.md](../development.md) to include how to execute your tests locally;
- [ ] **4.** In the Issues area of this repository, create a new issue titled `Additional Project Improvements` and list, in succinct bullet points, what other improvements you would have implemented in your solution or bugs you would have written a detailed report for if you had more time and resources.
